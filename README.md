# Intel-Verilog-HDL-Basics
This instructor-led class is taught in a virtual classroom over 2 half days of instruction. You will use a remote computer connected through webex for labs. No setup is needed. The remote computer connection does require that you are logged in using a computer running Windows.

## Course Description

This class is a general introduction to the Verilog language and its use in programmable logic design, covering the basic constructs used in both the simulation and synthesis environments. By the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of the Verilog module, data types, operators and assignment statements needed to begin creating your own designs, using both behavioral and structural approaches. In the hands-on laboratory sessions, you will get to practice the knowledge you have gained by writing simple but practical designs. You will check your designs by compiling in the Intel® Quartus® Prime software and simulating in the ModelSim* for Intel® FPGA Edition Software.

## Course Objectives

At course completion, you will be able to:

- Create a basic Verilog module
- Understand the difference between simulation and synthesis environments
- Understand Verilog data types and operators and their uses
- Model hardware and test using behavioral modeling constructs
- Model hardware and test using structural modeling constructs

## Skills Required

- Background in digital logic design
- Knowledge of simulation is a plus
- Prior knowledge of a programming language (e.g., "C" language) is a plus
- No prior knowledge of Verilog HDL or the Intel Quartus Prime software is needed
